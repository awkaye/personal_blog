<p class="me"><span>Kashieca Kaye P. Renoballes</span><br>
I am a Grade 9 student under the Science, Technology, and Engineering (STE) program. I am curious, hardworking, and eager to learn new things, especially in science and technology. I enjoy discovering how concepts we learn in school connect to real-life situations.<br>
I created this blog to share my journey as an STE student and to express my interests and experiences. This blog also allows me to practice creativity, improve my communication skills, and showcase what I have learned as a student in the modern digital world.
