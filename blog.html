<h1>My STE Journey</h1>
<p>Exploring science, technology, and student life as a Grade 9 STE learner.</p><br>
<p>Welcome to my personal blog! This blog was created to share my experiences, thoughts, and interests as a Grade 9 student under the Science, Technology, and Engineering (STE) program. Being an STE student challenges me to think critically, solve problems creatively, and appreciate how science and technology shape our daily lives.<br>
Through this blog, I want to express what I learn inside and outside the classroom, including my academic journey, personal growth, and interests. This website also serves as a creative space where I can document my ideas, reflect on my experiences, and improve my skills in technology and communication.</p>
